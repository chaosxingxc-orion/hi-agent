# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This repository is in **active implementation — production engineering phase**. All 6 engineering gates passed. The `architecture-review/` directory contains the full design baseline (V2.0).

## First Principles

- **P1**: The agent must continuously evolve
- **P2**: The cost of driving the agent must continuously decrease

## Current Implementation

## Test Coverage

2067 tests, all passing. One external dependency: `agent-kernel` (via GitHub). 252 source modules, ~34k lines.

## System Overview

**hi-agent** is an enterprise-grade intelligent agent built around the **TRACE framework**:

```
TRACE = Task → Route → Act → Capture → Evolve
```

The three-repository architecture:

- `D:\chao_workspace\hi-agent` (this repo) — the sole intelligent agent, owns all cognitive logic + all decision logic (restart policy, reflection, graph scheduling)
- `D:\chao_workspace\agent-kernel` — durable runtime substrate (run lifecycle, event log, TurnEngine, idempotency, state tracking)
- `D:\chao_workspace\external\agent-core` — reusable capability modules integrated into hi-agent (tools, retrieval, MCP, workflows)

## Architecture Layers

```
Model-Driven Management
  ModelRegistry → TierRouter → ModelSelector (budget-aware)
  LLMGateway (sync) + AsyncLLMGateway (async/httpx)

Middleware Layer (independent contexts, ~86% cost reduction)
  Perception(light) → Control(medium) → Execution(dynamic) → Evaluation(light)
  5-phase lifecycle: pre_create → pre_execute → execute → post_execute → pre_destroy

Task Management (asyncio-native)
  AsyncTaskScheduler(Semaphore backpressure) → GraphFactory → BudgetGuard
  RestartPolicyEngine(retry/reflect/escalate) → ReflectionOrchestrator
  RunContext(per-run state isolation) → RunContextManager(concurrent runs)

Context OS
  ContextManager → Session → Memory(3-tier + AsyncCompressor) → Knowledge(wiki+graph) → Skill(evolution)

Execution Modes
  execute()        — linear stage traversal (backward compatible)
  execute_graph()  — dynamic graph traversal with backtrack + route selection
  execute_async()  — full asyncio with AsyncTaskScheduler + KernelFacade
```

## 10 First-Class Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Task** | A formal task contract, not raw user input |
| **Run** | A durable long-running task execution entity |
| **Stage** | A formal phase in task progression |
| **Branch** | A logical trajectory in the exploration space |
| **Task View** | Minimal sufficient context rebuilt before each model call |
| **Action** | An external operation executed via Harness |
| **Memory** | What the agent has experienced — three tiers: short-term (session), mid-term (daily/dream), long-term (graph) |
| **Knowledge** | What the agent stably knows — wiki (text), user profile, knowledge graph (structured), four-layer retrieval |
| **Skill** | A reusable process unit with 5-stage lifecycle, version management, and evolution |
| **Feedback** | Optimization signals from results, evaluations, and experiments |

## Human Gate Types

- **Gate A** (`contract_correction`) — modify task contract mid-run
- **Gate B** (`route_direction`) — guide path selection
- **Gate C** (`artifact_review`) — review/edit outputs
- **Gate D** (`final_approval`) — gate high-risk final actions

## Standard Failure Codes

`missing_evidence`, `invalid_context`, `harness_denied`, `model_output_invalid`, `model_refusal`, `callback_timeout`, `no_progress`, `contradictory_evidence`, `unsafe_action_blocked`, `exploration_budget_exhausted`, `execution_budget_exhausted`

Defined in agent-kernel as `TraceFailureCode` (StrEnum), re-exported by `hi_agent.failures.taxonomy` as `FailureCode`.
