"""Run-level and kernel-level heartbeat detection for agent-kernel.

Why heartbeat matters for long-running agents
----------------------------------------------
A kernel run can silently get stuck: an external callback never arrives,
a tool activity hangs past the Temporal activity timeout, or the event log
falls behind.  Temporal's activity-level heartbeat (``activity.heartbeat()``)
covers the *activity* side.  This module covers the *run* side 鈥?whether a
run as a whole is still making forward progress.

Two components
--------------
1. **``RunHeartbeatMonitor``** 鈥?per-run liveness tracker.

   Implements ``ObservabilityHook`` so it receives every FSM state transition
   without additional wiring.  A background watchdog calls
   ``get_timed_out_runs()`` and injects a ``heartbeat_timeout`` signal through
   the canonical signal pathway; the existing Recovery authority handles the
   rest.  No new kernel authority is introduced.

2. **``KernelSelfHeartbeat``** 鈥?kernel component liveness.

   Verifies that event log and projection service are responsive.  Caches
   results so the sync ``HealthCheckFn`` interface (required by
   ``KernelHealthProbe``) is never blocked on an async I/O call.

Architecture invariants preserved
-----------------------------------
- Heartbeat state is *ephemeral* (in-memory).  On worker restart, runs
  re-establish heartbeat or get timed out fresh.  Persisting heartbeat
  state would create a distributed coordination problem for no safety gain.
- On timeout a ``heartbeat_timeout`` signal is injected via the existing
  signal path 鈫?RunActor 鈫?TurnEngine 鈫?Recovery.  The six-authority
  invariant is never broken.
- ``RunHeartbeatMonitor`` is NOT a seventh authority.  It is an operational
  watchdog that observes via the hook side-channel and acts via the substrate
  gateway signal interface.

Typical wiring::

    from agent_kernel.runtime.heartbeat import (
        HeartbeatPolicy,
        RunHeartbeatMonitor,
        KernelSelfHeartbeat,
    )
    from agent_kernel.runtime.observability_hooks import (
        CompositeObservabilityHook,
        LoggingObservabilityHook,
    )

    policy = HeartbeatPolicy()
    monitor = RunHeartbeatMonitor(policy=policy)

    bundle = RunActorDependencyBundle(
        ...
        observability_hook=CompositeObservabilityHook(
            [LoggingObservabilityHook(), monitor]
        ),
    )

    # In a background worker task:
    await monitor.watchdog_once(gateway=temporal_gateway)

    # Wire kernel self-check into health probe:
    self_hb = KernelSelfHeartbeat()
    health_probe.register_check("kernel_event_log", self_hb.event_log_check())
    health_probe.register_check("kernel_projection", self_hb.projection_check())
    await self_hb.refresh(event_log=event_log, projection=projection)
