"""TaskWatchdog: scans for stalled tasks and notifies via callback.

Integrates with ObservabilityHook to receive run-level events and map them
to task-level heartbeats.  Runs as a non-authority background service.

Architecture invariant: TaskWatchdog never writes to the event log directly.
All state changes go through TaskRegistry (in-process).  Stall handling
decisions are delegated to the caller via an async callback.

Business logic (RestartPolicyEngine) has been migrated to hi-agent.
