"""Provides minimal in-memory implementations for core kernel services.

This module intentionally implements the smallest executable subset required

  - Runtime event truth storage,
  - Projection catch-up and readiness checks,
  - Dispatch admission gate,
  - Executor entrypoint,
  - Recovery gate,

These implementations are designed for PoC and local tests. They preserve
contract semantics and strict boundaries, but they are not production storage.
