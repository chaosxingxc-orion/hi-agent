"""RetryingExecutorService 鈥?lightweight transient-retry wrapper for ExecutorService.

Implements P3b of the agent-kernel quality plan: wraps any ExecutorService
with up to ``max_attempts`` retries for ``TransientExecutionError``, adding
jittered exponential backoff so bursts of retries don't collide.

Design notes:
  - Only ``TransientExecutionError`` triggers a retry; all other exceptions
    propagate immediately (permanent failures, auth errors, etc.).
  - The wrapper is transparent: it passes all arguments through to the inner
    executor unchanged.
  - The default ``max_attempts=2`` means one automatic retry on the first
    transient failure; increase for longer retry budgets.
