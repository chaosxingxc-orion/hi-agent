"""v6.4 TurnEngine minimal canonical path implementation.

This implementation encodes the first authoritative execution path:
  RunActor -> TurnEngine -> Snapshot -> Admission -> Dedupe -> Executor.

The engine is intentionally narrow for PoC:
  - One turn performs at most one authoritative dispatch attempt.
  - Admission is evaluated at most once per turn.
  - Ambiguous side-effect evidence is surfaced as effect_unknown and translated
    into recovery_pending via FailureEnvelope.
