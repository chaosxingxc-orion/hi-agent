"""Planner-driven recovery gate implementation.

This gate translates planner output into the canonical ``RecoveryDecision``
contract. Keeping this logic in one place avoids decision-shape drift between
runtime callers and ensures mode/reason mapping stays deterministic.

``CompensationRegistry`` integration:
  When a ``CompensationRegistry`` is injected, the gate validates that a
  handler exists for the failing action's ``effect_class`` before emitting a
  ``static_compensation`` decision.  If no handler is registered the gate
  downgrades to ``abort`` and logs a warning 鈥?this prevents the kernel from
  emitting a compensation intent it can never fulfill.

``ReflectionPolicy`` integration:
  When a ``ReflectionPolicy``, ``ReasoningLoop``, and ``ReflectionContextBuilder``
  are all provided, the gate can override ``static_compensation`` or ``abort``
  decisions with ``reflect_and_retry`` when the failure kind is reflectable and
  the reflection round limit has not been reached.
