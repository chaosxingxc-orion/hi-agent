"""Compensation handler registry for static_compensation recovery mode.

Design rationale:
  ``RecoveryMode.static_compensation`` has always existed as a typed mode but
  the kernel had no mechanism to actually *execute* compensation 鈥?it could only
  record the intent.  This module closes that gap.

  A ``CompensationRegistry`` maps ``effect_class 鈫?async callable`` so the
  recovery path can look up and invoke the appropriate rollback handler when
  ``static_compensation`` is selected.  The registry is injected into
  ``PlannedRecoveryGateService``; if no handler is registered for a failing
  action's ``effect_class``, the gate downgrades the decision to ``abort``
  rather than emitting a compensation decision that can never execute.

Boundary:
  The registry is a *kernel-internal* facility.  Compensation callables receive
  the failed ``Action`` and are responsible for undoing its side effects.  They
  must not mutate kernel event log state directly; any observable state change
  should come through normal action dispatch.
