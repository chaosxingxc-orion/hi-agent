"""Replay fidelity verification for TurnEngine determinism.

Provides ReplayFidelityVerifier, which runs a TurnEngine turn twice (original
+ simulated-worker-restart replay) and produces a FidelityReport asserting
that both runs produce identical capability snapshot hashes and consistent
dedupe outcomes.

Useful for integration testing and operator validation after Worker crashes.
