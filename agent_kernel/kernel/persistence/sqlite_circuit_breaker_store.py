    Unix epoch floats so they are meaningful across process restarts (unlike
    ``time.monotonic()`` which resets per process).

    A single shared connection is kept open for the lifetime of the store.
    This is necessary for ``:memory:`` databases (each new connection would
    create a distinct empty database) and also avoids repeated connection
