"""Cross-store consistency verification utilities.

Provides ``verify_event_dedupe_consistency()`` for detecting state drift
between a ``KernelRuntimeEventLog`` and a ``DedupeStore`` for a given run.

Drift can occur when:
- A crash happens after ``dedupe_store.reserve()`` but before the event append,
  leaving a "reserved" key with no corresponding event in the log.
- An executor exception leaves dedupe in "unknown_effect" while the event log
  has no dispatch event, or vice-versa.

This checker is intentionally read-only and non-blocking: it produces a
``ConsistencyReport`` describing any discrepancies without mutating state.

    """Cross-checks EventLog and DedupeStore state for one run.

    Looks for two classes of drift:

    1. **Orphaned dedupe key** 鈥?a key exists in the dedupe store for this run
       but no event with a matching ``idempotency_key`` exists in the log.
       This indicates a crash after ``reserve()`` but before the event append,
       or a store that was populated outside the normal TurnEngine path.

    2. **Unknown-effect without log evidence** 鈥?a dedupe record is in state
       ``"unknown_effect"`` (executor crashed mid-flight) but the event log
       contains no ``turn.effect_unknown`` or ``turn.dispatched`` event for
       that key.  The executor outcome truly cannot be determined and human
       review is appropriate.

    The check is best-effort: it uses duck-typed access (``list_events`` /
    ``events`` attribute, then ``load`` coroutine) so it works with both the
    in-memory and SQLite implementations without hard coupling.  Async
    ``load()`` is called synchronously via ``asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete``
    only when no synchronous accessor is available; callers in async contexts
    should prefer the async variant ``averify_event_dedupe_consistency``.
