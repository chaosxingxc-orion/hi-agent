"""Saga-pattern reconciler for EventLog 鈫?DedupeStore consistency drift.

When a process crash leaves a dedupe key in ``"reserved"`` or ``"dispatched"``
state with no corresponding event in the event log, the :class:`DispatchOutboxReconciler`
repairs the inconsistency by transitioning the key to ``"unknown_effect"``.
This surfaces the ambiguous dispatch for recovery without silent loss.

For ``"unknown_effect"`` entries that already lack log evidence the reconciler
logs a WARNING for human review 鈥?auto-repair is not possible because the
outcome is genuinely unknown.

Typical usage inside an async startup or watchdog path::

    reconciler = DispatchOutboxReconciler()
    result = await reconciler.reconcile(event_log, dedupe_store, run_id)
    if not result.is_clean:
        logger.warning("Reconciliation repaired %d violations", result.violations_repaired)
