"""Temporal workflow gateway implementation for the kernel facade.

Design principles:
  - Temporal is treated as *durable runtime substrate* only.
  - Kernel semantics (lifecycle truth, projection truth,
    recovery truth) stay in kernel contracts and services.
  - This gateway only translates kernel-safe requests into
    Temporal SDK calls.

Why this module exists:
  - ``KernelFacade`` depends on ``TemporalWorkflowGateway``
    abstraction.
  - The abstraction allows deterministic unit tests against mocks.
  - The concrete implementation is isolated, so SDK-specific
    behavior does not leak into domain modules.
